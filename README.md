# Threat Hunt Report: Fabricated Support Incident and Data Exfiltration

<img width="1024" height="965" alt="Data Exfiltration Image v5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/103db624-3abf-44be-88ac-8772cb1b101b" />

##  Scenario

Subsequent analysis of a routine support request reveals behavior inconsistent with typical remote assistance. Multiple artifacts were left behind, including unusual process executions and system modifications. Notably, a post-session narrative was introduced to explain away anomalies, though forensic traces suggest a premeditated sequence of access and manipulation. This investigation seeks to reconstruct the timeline of activity and determine whether the actions taken were aligned with support protocols or if they were intentionally staged under the guise of assistance.

## Background
**Incident Date:** 09 October 2025  
**Compromised Host:** gab-intern-vm  

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Initial Execution Detection

Searched for files created in the user's Downloads folder during the investigation timeframe and discovered SupportTool.ps1 created on 10/9/2025 at 12:22 PM by powershell.exe in the user's Downloads folder at C:\Users\g4bri3lintern\Downloads\. Next, searched for the execution of SupportTool.ps1 to identify command-line parameters. The first execution revealed the attacker used -ExecutionPolicy Bypass to circumvent PowerShell security controls by bypassing PowerShell's execution policy. 

**Queries used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-01) .. datetime(2025-10-15))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where FileName contains "desk" or FileName contains "help" or FileName contains "support" or FileName contains "tool"
| where FolderPath contains "Downloads"
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```

---

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09) .. datetime(2025-10-10))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "SupportTool.ps1"
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, AccountName
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="2868" height="657" alt="Query1B Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2c3abe4-f2fe-446f-b99c-36f6eea3cc2c" />

---

### 2. Defense Disabling

Searched for evidence of staged artifacts and discovered that DefenderTamperArtifact.lnk was created on 10/09/2025 at 12:34 PM. This shortcut file in the Recent folder indicates that the attacker may have manually accessed a file designed to simulate Windows Defender tampering.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09) .. datetime(2025-10-10))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where FolderPath contains "Recent"
| where ActionType == "FileCreated"
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="1954" height="876" alt="Query2 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4808772a-3c7e-4b05-a7dc-8523b7ff72cf" />

---

### 3. Data Probe

Searched for clipboard access attempts and discovered the attacker executed the following clipboard data probe: "powershell.exe" -NoProfile -Sta -Command "try { Get-Clipboard | Out-Null } catch { }" on 10/09/2025 at 12:50 PM. This PowerShell command attempts to quietly query the clipboard, possibly in an attempt to capture any sensitive or copied data present (e.g., passwords or credit card numbers), essentially leveraging Get-Clipboard for a low-effort win.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09) .. datetime(2025-10-10))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "clip" 
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="2539" height="721" alt="Query3 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35926e7e-bc2c-4b88-ad02-d602ffd1d054" />

---

### 4. Host Context Reconnaissance

Searched for host reconnaissance commands and identified a qwinsta session query executed on 10/09/2025 at 12:51 PM (i.e., 2025-10-09T12:51:44.3425653Z).

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09) .. datetime(2025-10-10))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "qwi"
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated desc

```
<img width="1783" height="473" alt="Query4 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1319b432-7596-4cd3-b20a-a38982c6caac" />

---

### 5. Storage Surface Mapping

Searched for storage-related reconnaissance by querying storage enumeration commands. The second command tied to this activity was: "cmd.exe" /c wmic logicaldisk get name,freespace,size, likely used for checking local disk space.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09) .. datetime(2025-10-10))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("net share", "net use", "wmic logicaldisk", "Get-PSDrive")
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="2000" height="347" alt="Query5 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64f12ca7-6b53-4bd2-9f74-d51d4894b5ec" />

---

### 6. Connectivity and Name Resolution Check 

Searched for network reachability and name resolution checks and discovered connectivity checks initiated by RuntimeBroker.exe as the parent process.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09) .. datetime(2025-10-10))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("ping", "nslookup", "Test-Connection", "Resolve-DnsName", "ipconfig", "tracert", "Test-NetConnection")
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessParentFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="2867" height="597" alt="Query6 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f50369b-c546-49e4-a907-d92003348b94" />

---

### 7. Interactive Session Discovery

Searched for session enumeration and identified that the PowerShell session (InitiatingProcessUniqueId: 2533274790397065) executed on 10/9/2025 at 12:50 PM was the initiating process of cmd.exe running qwinsta in order to detect active user sessions which helps the attacker decide their next step (i.e., act immediately or wait).

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09) .. datetime(2025-10-10))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "qwi"
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessUniqueId
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="2432" height="459" alt="Query7 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d46fcc05-35ab-4231-89e0-f07fc62dff24" />

---

### 8. Runtime Application Inventory

Searched for process enumeration commands and discovered that the attacker used tasklist /v to get a complete inventory of all running processes, applications, and services on the host. Also, identified that the file name of the process that was used for runtime inventory was tasklist.exe.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09) .. datetime(2025-10-10))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains ("tasklist")
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated desc

```
<img width="1908" height="322" alt="Query8 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8af07514-4dfd-41cc-8433-b2700ab2bfeb" />

---

### 9. Privilege Surface Check

Searched for privilege enumeration commands and discovered that the first privilege check occurred at 2025-10-09T12:52:14.3135459Z. The attacker used whoami /groups to enumerate the group memberships of the user in an attempt to understand what privileges they had. This allows the attacker to decide whether they could proceed with their current access level or if they need to attempt privilege escalation.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09) .. datetime(2025-10-10))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("whoami")
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="1918" height="727" alt="Query9 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fc9d937-1fc6-4fa5-b5e1-2d6357adfaaa" />

---

### 10. Proof-of-Access and Egress Validation

Searched for outbound connectivity tests and identified that the first outbound destination contacted was www.msftconnecttest.com which is a Microsoft connectivity test endpoint used to validate internet connectivity. In other words, the attacker used a legitimate Microsoft connectivity test service to validate outbound internet access before attempting data exfiltration.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09 12:50:00) .. datetime(2025-10-09 13:50:00))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where InitiatingProcessFileName == "powershell.exe"
| project TimeGenerated, RemoteUrl, RemoteIP, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="2551" height="382" alt="Query10 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25055020-f770-4c80-8b29-1275aa3af22f" />

---

### 11. Bundling and Staging Artifacts 

Searched for signs of file consolidation and packaging and identified that the first folder used for bundling the collected data was: C:\Users\Public\ReconArtifacts.zip.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09 12:50:00) .. datetime(2025-10-09 13:50:00))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where FileName endswith ".zip"
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="2724" height="605" alt="Query11 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d081aed5-7724-4a7e-b5d7-b70c4c29cf05" />

---
### 12. Outbound Transfer Attempt

Searched for unusual outbound connections and found that a connection to 100.29.147.161 (i.e., httpbin.org) occurred at 1:00:40 PM. Note: httpbin.org is a publicly available testing service used to validate HTTP upload capability.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09 13:00:00) .. datetime(2025-10-09 14:00:00))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where RemoteUrl != ""
| project TimeGenerated, RemoteUrl, RemoteIP, RemotePort, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="2443" height="926" alt="Query12 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68136d27-1688-4020-8571-b83102914bec" />

---

### 13. Scheduled Re-execution Persistence

Searched for scheduled task creation commands and found a scheduled task named SupportToolUpdater configured to run ONLOGON. This ensures that SupportTool.ps1 runs automatically every time the user logs in. Additional parameters include -WindowStyle (set to Hidden) and -ExecutionPolicy (set to Bypass), allowing it to execute while avoiding detection and bypassing security.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09) .. datetime(2025-10-10))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "schtasks"
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="2783" height="323" alt="Query13 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1bdcde3-14ad-45f3-8a55-6c8c0f11e292" />

---

### 14. Autorun Fallback Persistence

Searched for registry modifications for autorun fallback persistence. Although DeviceRegistryEvents showed no results, the attacker created a registry value named RemoteAssistUpdater as part of their fallback persistence mechanism. In other words, the attacker created redundant persistence so if the primary persistence mechanism (i.e., the scheduled task) is removed or disabled, this will keep them in the system.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09) .. datetime(2025-10-10))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where RegistryKey contains "run"
| project TimeGenerated, RegistryKey, RegistryValueName, RegistryValueData, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| sort by TimeGenerated asc
```
---

### 15. Planted Narrative and Cover Artifact

Searched for explanatory artifacts created around the time of the suspicious activity that might serve as planted narratives and identified that the file name of the artifact left behind was SupportChat_log.lnk.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-09 12:20:00) .. datetime(2025-10-09 14:00:00))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where FileName contains "Support"
| project TimeGenerated, FileName, FolderPath, ActionType, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by TimeGenerated asc

```
<img width="2470" height="659" alt="Query15 Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5ce65ce-b182-4f81-bc4c-7cf78cdd2618" />

---

## Summary

The analysis revealed that the target device, gab-intern-vm, was compromised and the subsequent attacks were disguised as a legitimate support session. The attacker orchestrated a multi-stage attack including the execution of a malicious PowerShell script with bypassed security policies, planted artifacts to create false narratives, clipboard content exfiltration, extensive reconnaissance (i.e., host enumeration, session discovery, storage mapping, connectivity validation, process inventory, and privilege checks), egress validation which involved testing internet connectivity and upload capability, the consolidation of collected artifacts into compressed archives, dual persistence (i.e., scheduled tasks and registry autoruns for long-term access), and fabricated support chat logs. The sophistication of this attack hints at an experienced threat actor with knowledge of defensive detection capabilities.
